# Games

Currently, Tic-Tac-Toe and Tetris are working.  To play either, clone down the repository, set the appropriate UI project as the startup, and play.

Snake and Minesweeper are still works in progress.

Tic-Tac-Toe, Tetris, and Snake are all based off of YouTube tutorials by OttoBotCode https://www.youtube.com/@OttoBotCode .

Minesweeper will be the result of my own flailing around eventually.
